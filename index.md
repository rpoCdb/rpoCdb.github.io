# Welcome to the *rpoC* Database!  

The current version of the database (**v 2.0**) contains `65,156` unique, high-quality *rpoC* full-length gene sequences, spanning both bacterial and archaeal lineages. This resource supports microbiome and prokaryotic phylogenetic research by enabling precise taxonomic profiling and robust phylogenetic analysis. 

## Why *rpoC*?

The *rpoC* gene encodes the Œ≤' subunit of the DNA-directed RNA polymerase complex -- an essential enzyme for all cellular life. As a single-copy, protein-coding marker gene, *rpoC* offers distinct advantages for microbial community analysis:

üîç **High Phylogenetic Resolution** - Discriminates taxa at the species and strain level, surpassing limiations of ribosomal RNA genes

üåç **Universal Applicability** - Features a conserved domain (RNA_pol_N terminal region) for reliable primer design across diverse prokaryotes

üß¨ **Single Copy Locus** - Unlike multi-copy markers (e.g., 16S rRNA), *rpoC* avoids biases in abundance estimates.

üí≤ **Cost Effective** - Uses standard PCR/sequencing protocols and is cheaper than whole-genome sequencing

While 16S rRNA sequencing remains a gold standard for microbial surveys, *rpoC* complements and expands the toolkit for researchers seeking finer taxonomic granularity and functional insights into microbial ecology.
