# Welcome to the *rpoC* Database!  

We're excited to share **Version 2.0** of our curated database, containing `////` unique, high-quality *rpoC* full-gene sequences. This resource supports microbiome research in taxonomic profiling and phylogenetics.

## Key Features
- **Formats**: Pre-formatted for QIIME2 (`.qza`), Kraken2, DADA2  
- **Metadata**: NCBI taxonomy IDs, sequence length, absolute rpoC primers sequences by taxonomy  
- **Download**: [Full database](#) \| [Preformatted databases](#)  

## Why Use *rpoC*?
🧬 **Single-Copy Gene**:  
   - Eliminates copy number bias in abundance estimates  

🔍 **Higher Taxonomic Resolution**:  
   - Distinguishes closely related species better than 16S rRNA  

💲 **Cost-Effective**:  
   - Uses standard PCR/sequencing protocols (cheaper than whole-genome)  

## Who This Database Is For
🔬 **Microbiome Researchers**:  
   - Studying bacterial phylogeny/diversity  
   - Needing standardized *rpoC* references  

🧪 **Bioinformatics Labs**:  
   - Building custom taxonomic classifiers  
   - Reproducing published analyses
